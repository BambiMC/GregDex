Most got NEI Support now, but there is still some left without it.\",1:\"1. Coloring Items and Blocks: You know those Crafting Recipes, which have a dye surrounded by 8 Item to dye them? Or the ones which have just one Item and one Dye in the Grid? Those two Recipe Types can be cheaply automated using the Printer.\",2:\"The Colorization Functionality even optimizes the Recipes, which normally require 8 Items + 1 Dye to 1 Item and an 8th of the normally used Dye in Fluid Form, isn't that awesome?\",3:\"2. Copying Books: This Task got slightly harder. The first Step is putting the written and signed Book inside the Scanner with a Data Stick ready to receive the Data.\",4:\"Now insert the Stick into the Data Slot of the Printer and add 3 pieces of Paper together with 144 Liters of actual Ink Fluid. Water mixed and chemical Dyes won't work on Paper without messing things up!\",5:\"You got a stack of Pages for your new Book, just put them into the Assembler with some Glue and a piece of Leather for the Binding, and you receive an identical copy of the Book, which would stack together with the original.\",6:\"3. Renaming Items: This Functionality is no longer Part of the Printer. There is now a Name Mold for the Forming Press to imprint a Name into an Item, just rename the Mold in an Anvil and use it in the Forming Press on any Item.\",7:\"4. Crafting of Books, Maps, Nametags etc etc etc: Those Recipes moved to other Machines, just look them up in NEI.\",8:\"Credits to Gregorius Techneticies for writing this Book.
